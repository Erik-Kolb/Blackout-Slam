# Blackout-Slam

Project Overview:

Simultaneous Localization and Mapping (SLAM) is a core technology for autonomous navigation, with applications in commercial robotics, defense, and automotive systems. SLAM systems enable an agent to create maps of its environment while tracking its own position. However, most current SLAM systems rely on light-emitting sensors like LiDAR, which pose risks in military operations by increasing detectability. To address this, our project, Blackout SLAM, aims to develop a system that eliminates the use of light-emitting sensors, providing a covert solution suitable for military operations where stealth is critical. 

In military operations, LiDAR's reliance on infrared light makes it detectable by night-vision devices (NVDs). This vulnerability can compromise mission success by allowing adversaries to detect our mapping systems. The primary goal of Blackout SLAM is to mitigate this risk by replacing LiDAR with non-light-emitting sensors. These sensors will enhance the covert mapping and localization capabilities of autonomous systems, ensuring stealth during operations in contested environments. By developing a SLAM system that utilizes non-light-emitting sensors, Blackout SLAM will provide ground vehicles with a robust, stealthy navigation and mapping tool.  

Most existing SLAM systems rely on light-emitting sensors, which can be easily detected by adversarial forces, especially in environments where stealth is essential. The challenge is to design a SLAM system that utilizes non-light-emitting sensors for both mapping and localization, ensuring operational secrecy. This system must maintain the accuracy and efficiency of current SLAM technologies while being undetectable by NVDs. 

The Blackout SLAM project will deliver a non-light-emitting SLAM system capable of generating a map of the environment and localizing within it. The system will use sensors that are undetectable by NVDs and remain invisible to the naked eye. By eliminating light emissions, this system will significantly enhance the operational security of autonomous ground vehicles in military applications.
